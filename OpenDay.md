# UTM Digital Day Reflection: Insights on Project Management & System Development

**UTM Digital Day** was held on **29th October**. I had the incredible opportunity to attend a talk by **Mr. Helmee bin Yaacob** about **Project Management and System Development**.

Thank you, Mr. Helmee, for such an inspiring talk. I have gained a lot of knowledge from you. For instance, I learned about agile methodology in DDI development approach and 12 agile principles.

His life journey to get to where he is now has also given me a lot of motivation to never give up and keep moving forward. Not only that, being able to visit the booths has gave me the insights of how the real industry works. This made me realised that attending classes alone isn't enough. I have to put in extra work to get more experience and knowledge. It could either be learning new programming languages, sharpens my communication skills and work more in group settings to learn team works and leadership skills.

## **Final Thoughts**

The UTM Digital Day was more than just an event. It was a **mindset shift**. Mr. Helmee didn't just teach us about project management. He showed us how to **think like professionals** and **build like innovators**.

The most valuable lesson wasn't in the slides, but it is the **story behind his success**. The late nights, the failed attempts, the persistence, and the eventual breakthrough.

> **The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle for what you done love.**
